# NSW Agency Helm Chart

Helm chart for deploying the **NSW Agency** application. A single image serves
both the API and the officer portal from one process, so the chart deploys a
single release. Supply your environment's settings by layering the example
override file from the parent `helm/` directory on top of the chart defaults.

## Files Included
- **[deployment.yaml](templates/deployment.yaml)**: Deployment, container, ports, environment variables, mounts, and probes.
- **[service.yaml](templates/service.yaml)**: Exposes the container port as a cluster-internal Service.
- **[route.yaml](templates/route.yaml)**: Exposes the Service externally via an OpenShift Route (when `route.enabled`).
- **[ingress.yaml](templates/ingress.yaml)**: Exposes the Service externally via a Kubernetes Ingress (when `ingress.enabled`).

## Layout

```
deployments/helm/
├── agency/            # this chart (templates + neutral defaults)
└── values-example.yaml    # complete example override (API + portal)
```

## Usage

```bash
helm install nsw-agency ./agency -f ../values-example.yaml
```

`values.yaml` holds only neutral defaults. The image, port, environment, and
ingress/route settings live in the example override file — copy it and fill in
your environment's URLs, client IDs, and OU handle. Note that **`image.tag` is
required** (there is no default — see [Releasing](#releasing)); the example file
sets one, or pass `--set image.tag=<version>`.

### Prerequisite: secrets

Secrets are **not** stored in the values files — they are referenced from a
Kubernetes Secret that you create out-of-band before installing:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic nsw-agency-secrets \
  --from-literal=db-password=... \
  --from-literal=nsw-client-secret=...
```

## Accessing the portal (secure context required)

The officer portal logs in via OIDC with PKCE, which uses the Web Crypto API
(`window.crypto.subtle`). Browsers only expose Web Crypto in a **secure
context** — that means **HTTPS**, or plain HTTP on **`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`**.
On a plain-HTTP, non-localhost origin (e.g. `http://agency.example.com` through
an ingress), `crypto.subtle` is `undefined` and `signinRedirect()` fails
silently *after* fetching the discovery document — the page just sits there with
no redirect and no error.

So serve the portal one of these ways:

- **HTTPS** (production and recommended for any real host): terminate TLS at the
  ingress via `ingress.tls` (referencing a `kubernetes.io/tls` Secret) or at the
  OpenShift `route`, and browse `https://<host>`.
- **`localhost` over HTTP** (quick local testing): `kubectl port-forward
  svc/<release> 8080:80` and browse `http://localhost:8080`.

Whichever you pick, `VITE_APP_URL` (the OIDC `redirect_uri`) must **exactly
equal** the origin you browse and be registered as an allowed redirect URI in
the IdP. A quick check in the browser console: `window.isSecureContext` must be
`true`.

## Releasing

The **app image** and the **chart** are versioned and released independently,
because they change at different rates. Each has its own tag namespace:

| Artifact  | Tag            | Workflow                                                            | Publishes                                         |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| App image | `v1.2.3`       | [`release.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/release.yml)             | `ghcr.io/opennsw/agency:1.2.3` + a GitHub Release |
| Chart     | `chart-v0.3.0` | [`release-chart.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/release-chart.yml) | `oci://ghcr.io/opennsw/charts/agency:0.3.0`   |

### `appVersion` vs `image.tag`

These are **not** the same thing, and the chart does not couple them:

- **`appVersion`** (in `Chart.yaml`) is metadata only — a human-readable label
  for "which app version this chart describes." It never sets the image tag.
- **`image.tag`** (in a values file, or `--set image.tag=`) is **required** and
  has no default. The chart deliberately fails to render if it is unset, so a
  missing/typo'd tag is caught at `helm template` time — not as an
  `ImagePullBackOff` at deploy time.

### Releasing the chart

Because chart releases are decoupled, cut them on their own cadence:

```bash
# 1. (Only if you want the chart's DEFAULT image to track a new app version)
#    Edit deployments/helm/agency/Chart.yaml:
#      appVersion: "1.2.3"   # metadata; also bump `version:` if you prefer
#    …and set a matching image.tag in your example/prod values file.
#
# 2. Tag and push. The chart version comes from the tag; appVersion is read
#    from Chart.yaml (NOT overridden by the workflow).
git tag chart-v0.3.0
git push origin chart-v0.3.0
# → published to oci://ghcr.io/opennsw/charts/agency:0.3.0
```

To publish manually (the workflow does exactly this):

```bash
echo "$GITHUB_TOKEN" | helm registry login ghcr.io -u <user> --password-stdin
helm package deployments/helm/agency --version 0.3.0
helm push agency-0.3.0.tgz oci://ghcr.io/opennsw/charts
```

### Development builds

[`build-dev-chart.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/build-dev-chart.yml) publishes
a prerelease chart on every push to `main`/`migration/*` that touches
`deployments/helm/**`, versioned `0.0.0-dev.<run-number>` (e.g. `0.0.0-dev.42`).
Prerelease versions sort below any stable release, so they are only installed
when asked for explicitly, and you must supply the dev `image.tag` to test
against:

```bash
helm install nsw-agency oci://ghcr.io/opennsw/charts/agency \
  --version 0.0.0-dev.42 \
  --set image.tag=dev-42-<sha> -f your-values.yaml
# or pull the latest prerelease:
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/opennsw/charts/agency --devel
```

## Consuming the published chart

OCI charts need no `helm repo add`. Install directly by reference:

```bash
helm install nsw-agency \
  oci://ghcr.io/opennsw/charts/agency --version 0.1.0 \
  -f values-example.yaml
```

> **The override file is NOT bundled with the published chart.**
> `helm package` only includes this chart directory, so `values-example.yaml`
> (which lives one level up in `deployments/helm/`) does not travel with the OCI
> artifact. A consumer gets the templates and the neutral `values.yaml` defaults
> only — you must supply your own `-f` values file. Grab a starting point from
> this repo's [`deployments/helm/`](../) directory and fill in the placeholder
> URLs, client IDs, and OU handles for your environment.

If the GHCR package is private, `helm registry login ghcr.io` first; otherwise
make the `charts/agency` package public in the org's package settings.
